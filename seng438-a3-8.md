# 1 Introduction

This assignment focuses on JUnit testing and testing tools using white-box coverage criteria technique for test suites. The objective of this assignment is to equip students with the adequacy of a white-box test suite based on code coverage.

In order to measure the adequacy of a test suite, this assignment covers control-flow coverage criteria such as statement coverage, decision coverage, condition coverage and path coverage, and data-flow coverage criteria such as DU pairs coverage.

# 2 Manual data-flow coverage calculations for X and Y methods

1. Data Flow Graph
   - DataUtilities.calculateColumnTotal
   - Range.Intersects
1. the def-use sets per statement
   - DataUtilities.calculateColumnTotal
   - Range.Intersects
1. list all DU-pairs per variable
   - DataUtilities.calculateColumnTotal
     - data: (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 12)
     - column: (1, 5), (1, 12)
     - total: (2, 7), (2, 10), (15, 15)
     - rowCount: (3, 4), (3, 9)
     - r: (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 8)
     - n: (5, 7), (5, 12), (5, 13), (5, 15)
     - r2: (9, 12), (9, 14)
   - Range.Intersects
     - b0: (1, 1), (1, 3)
     - b1: (1, 2), (1, 3)
1. for each test case show which pairs are covered
   - DataUtilities.calculateColumnTotal
   - Range.Intersects
     - (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3)
1. calculate the DU-Pair coverage.
   - DataUtilities.calculateColumnTotal
   - Range.Intersects
